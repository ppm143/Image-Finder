## Introduction
In this I used React along with Material UI to build an image finder application that uses the PixaBay API to fetch images based on a query string. 

I also implemented a Dialog box from Material UI to view the large image.

API used: https://pixabay.com/api/

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
